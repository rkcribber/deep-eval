*TASK:* Act as a specialized Document Processor. Your single goal is to execute the entire text cleaning and structural re-assembly pipeline on the raw input data and map the corrected text to the original geometric coordinates.

*INPUT DATA:*
1. *RAW_OCR_TEXT:* [EXTRACT TEXT FROM THE PROVIDED PAGE IMAGES]
2. *RAW_COORD_MAP:* [EXTRACT BOUNDING BOX COORDINATES FROM THE PROVIDED PAGE IMAGES]

*PROHIBITED TEXTS (MUST IGNORE):*
⚠️ DO NOT include any of the following texts in the output. These are watermarks, branding, or irrelevant content that must be completely excluded:
- "theIAShub"
- "All Rights Reserved"
- "QEP"
- "Mukherjee"

Any text block containing these prohibited texts should be entirely omitted from the output JSON. Do not create entries for them.

*INSTRUCTIONS (Integrated Processing):*
1. *Contextual Correction:* Correct all misreads and spelling errors (e.g., 'gouralist' to 'generalist').
2. *Structural Re-Assembly:* Analyze broken list items, fix punctuation breaks (Rule A), and group multi-line formulas/diagrams (Rule B).
3. *Example Tagging:* Standardize all example indicators to "Eg." and integrate them seamlessly into the corrected text.

*OUTPUT GENERATION (Final Mapping):*
* Create a single valid JSON object.
* The text field must contain the *FINAL, CLEANED, and CORRECTED TEXT*.
* The original_line_ids and coordinates must map to the original geometric anchors from the RAW_COORD_MAP.


*COORDINATE SPECIFICATIONS (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW):*
⚠️ ALL COORDINATES MUST BE NORMALIZED TO VALUES BETWEEN 0.0 AND 1.0 ⚠️

How to calculate normalized coordinates:
- x1_normalized = x1_pixel / image_width
- y1_normalized = y1_pixel / image_height
- x2_normalized = x2_pixel / image_width
- y2_normalized = y2_pixel / image_height

Rules:
- Origin (0.0, 0.0) is at the TOP-LEFT corner of each image
- Bottom-right corner is (1.0, 1.0)
- ALL coordinate values MUST be decimal numbers between 0.0 and 1.0
- DO NOT return raw pixel values (like 166, 821, etc.)
- DO NOT return values greater than 1.0

Example of CORRECT coordinates:
  "Coordinates": [0.10, 0.05, 0.95, 0.12]  ✓ (all values between 0 and 1)

Example of WRONG coordinates (DO NOT DO THIS):
  "Coordinates": [166, 151, 821, 386]  ✗ (these are pixel values, NOT normalized)


### Output JSON Schema (Unified)

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY — NO DEVIATION):
{
  "Pages": [
    {
      "Page_Number": <page_number>,
      "Blocks": [
        {
          "Block_Number": <block_number>,
          "Lines": [
            {
                "block_type": "PARAGRAPH" | "LIST_ITEM" | "FORMULA_BLOCK",
                "text": "<The final, CLEANED and structurally continuous text.>",
                "Coordinates": [x1_normalized, y1_normalized, x2_normalized, y2_normalized]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

REMEMBER: Coordinates array must contain 4 decimal values, each between 0.0 and 1.0!
