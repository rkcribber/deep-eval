*TASK:* Act as a specialized Document Processor. Your goals are:
1. **FIRST: Detect empty pages** - Check if the first two pages are partially empty (>20% empty).
2. Execute the entire text cleaning and structural re-assembly pipeline on the raw input data and map the corrected text to the original geometric coordinates.

⚠️ **CRITICAL - TEXT OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- ALL "text" fields MUST contain readable text in their ORIGINAL SCRIPT (Devanagari for Hindi, English for English, etc.)
- DO NOT output Unicode escape sequences like \u0915\u0943\u092a\u092f\u093e
- Output the actual readable characters: कृपया, राज्यव्यवस्था, संविधान, etc.
- The JSON response must be UTF-8 encoded with human-readable text, NOT escaped Unicode

*INPUT DATA:*
1. *RAW_OCR_TEXT:* [EXTRACT TEXT FROM THE PROVIDED PAGE IMAGES]
2. *RAW_COORD_MAP:* [EXTRACT BOUNDING BOX COORDINATES FROM THE PROVIDED PAGE IMAGES]

*EMPTY PAGE DETECTION & BLANK PAGE INSERTION (CRITICAL - PROCESS FIRST):*
⚠️ BEFORE processing any text, you MUST check the first two pages for emptiness:

**Step 1: Analyze Pages 1 and 2**
- Calculate the empty percentage for each of the first two pages
- A page's empty percentage is the portion of the page without text/content
- Ignore watermarks and prohibited texts when calculating content

**Step 2: If BOTH page_1_empty_percentage > 50% AND page_2_empty_percentage > 50%:**
- Set "insert_blank_page": true
- Set "blank_page_position": 1
- **CRITICAL: Insert NEW BLANK PAGE at position 1 and renumber ALL pages**
  - NEW BLANK PAGE → becomes Page 1
  - Original Page 1 → becomes Page 2
  - Original Page 2 → becomes Page 3
  - Original Page 3 → becomes Page 4
  - ... and so on

**Step 3: If BOTH page_1_empty_percentage > 20% AND page_2_empty_percentage > 20% (but NOT both > 50%):**
- Set "insert_blank_page": true
- Set "blank_page_position": 3
- **CRITICAL: Insert NEW BLANK PAGE at position 3 and renumber subsequent pages**
  - Original Page 1 → stays Page 1
  - Original Page 2 → stays Page 2
  - NEW BLANK PAGE → becomes Page 3
  - Original Page 3 → becomes Page 4
  - Original Page 4 → becomes Page 5
  - ... and so on

**Step 4: If either page has 20% or less empty space (has significant content):**
- Set "insert_blank_page": true
- Set "blank_page_position": 1
- **CRITICAL: Insert NEW BLANK PAGE at position 1 and renumber ALL pages**
  - NEW BLANK PAGE → becomes Page 1
  - Original Page 1 → becomes Page 2
  - Original Page 2 → becomes Page 3
  - Original Page 3 → becomes Page 4
  - ... and so on

⚠️ IMPORTANT: A blank page is ALWAYS inserted. All coordinates and page numbers in the output must reflect the NEW page numbering system AFTER the blank page insertion. The OCR coordinates should correspond to the final page positions.

*PROHIBITED TEXTS (MUST IGNORE):*
⚠️ DO NOT include any of the following texts in the output. These are watermarks, branding, or irrelevant content that must be completely excluded:
- "theIAShub"
- "All Rights Reserved"
- "QEP"
- "Mukherjee"

Any text block containing these prohibited texts should be entirely omitted from the output JSON. Do not create entries for them.

*INSTRUCTIONS (Integrated Processing):*
1. *Contextual Correction:* Correct all misreads and spelling errors (e.g., 'gouralist' to 'generalist').
2. *Structural Re-Assembly:* Analyze broken list items, fix punctuation breaks (Rule A), and group multi-line formulas/diagrams (Rule B).
3. *Example Tagging:* Standardize all example indicators to "Eg." and integrate them seamlessly into the corrected text.


*OUTPUT GENERATION (Final Mapping):*
* Create a single valid JSON object.
* The text field must contain the *FINAL, CLEANED, and CORRECTED TEXT*.
* ⚠️ **TEXT MUST BE IN READABLE DEVANAGARI SCRIPT** (e.g., "कृपया प्रश्नों के उत्तर"), NOT Unicode escapes (e.g., "\u0915\u0943\u092a\u092f\u093e")
* The original_line_ids and coordinates must map to the original geometric anchors from the RAW_COORD_MAP.


*COORDINATE SPECIFICATIONS (CRITICAL - MUST FOLLOW):*
⚠️ ALL COORDINATES MUST BE NORMALIZED TO VALUES BETWEEN 0.0 AND 1.0 ⚠️

How to calculate normalized coordinates:
- x1_normalized = x1_pixel / image_width
- y1_normalized = y1_pixel / image_height
- x2_normalized = x2_pixel / image_width
- y2_normalized = y2_pixel / image_height

Rules:
- Origin (0.0, 0.0) is at the TOP-LEFT corner of each image
- Bottom-right corner is (1.0, 1.0)
- ALL coordinate values MUST be decimal numbers between 0.0 and 1.0
- DO NOT return raw pixel values (like 166, 821, etc.)
- DO NOT return values greater than 1.0

⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL - STRICT JSON COORDINATE FORMAT - READ CAREFULLY ⚠️⚠️⚠️

**ABSOLUTE RULES FOR COORDINATES ARRAYS:**
1. Coordinates array MUST contain EXACTLY 4 numeric values - nothing else
2. Each value MUST be a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0
3. Format: "Coordinates": [x1, y1, x2, y2] where ALL are pure numbers
4. NEVER insert ANY text, Hindi text, English text, or any non-numeric content
5. NEVER let text from the "text" field leak into the Coordinates array
6. Each coordinate entry must be completely separate from text content

**COMMON ERROR TO AVOID - DO NOT DO THIS:**
This is WRONG (text leaked into coordinates):
```json
{
  "text": "→ शिक्षा और रोजगार के अवसरों में आरक्षण",
  "Coordinates": [
    0.22,
    0.627,
 विशेषाधिकार (Art 29, Art 30)",   <-- WRONG! Text inside coordinates!
    0.862,
    0.712
  ]
}
```

This is CORRECT (coordinates are pure numbers only):
```json
{
  "text": "→ शिक्षा और रोजगार के अवसरों में आरक्षण",
  "Coordinates": [0.22, 0.627, 0.862, 0.712]
}
```

**VALIDATION BEFORE OUTPUT:**
Before outputting each Coordinates array, verify:
✓ Exactly 4 values
✓ All values are decimal numbers (0.0 to 1.0)
✓ No text, Hindi, English, or special characters
✓ No newlines or extra content inside the array

Example of CORRECT coordinates:
  "Coordinates": [0.10, 0.05, 0.95, 0.12]  ✓ (all values are pure decimal numbers)

Examples of WRONG coordinates (NEVER DO THIS):
  "Coordinates": [166, 151, 821, 386]  ✗ (pixel values, not normalized)
  "Coordinates": [0 astounding, 0.5, 0.9, 0.12]  ✗ (INVALID - contains word)
  "Coordinates": [0.1, 0.2, विशेषाधिकार, 0.9]  ✗ (INVALID - Hindi text inside)
  "Coordinates": [0.1, 0.2, "Art 29", 0.9]  ✗ (INVALID - English text inside)
  "Coordinates": ["0.1", "0.2", "0.8", "0.9"]  ✗ (INVALID - strings instead of numbers)


### Output JSON Schema (Unified)

OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY — NO DEVIATION):
{
  "empty_page_detection": {
    "page_1_empty_percentage": <0-100 number>,
    "page_2_empty_percentage": <0-100 number>,
    "both_pages_mostly_empty": <true/false>,
    "insert_blank_page": true,
    "blank_page_position": <1 or 3>
  },
  "Pages": [
    {
      "Page_Number": <page_number - MUST reflect NEW numbering if blank page inserted>,
      "Original_Page_Number": <original page number before any insertion>,
      "Is_Inserted_Blank": <true/false - set true ONLY for the inserted blank page>,
      "Blocks": [
        {
          "Block_Number": <block_number>,
          "Lines": [
            {
                "block_type": "PARAGRAPH" | "LIST_ITEM" | "FORMULA_BLOCK",
                "text": "<The final, CLEANED and structurally continuous text.>",
                "Coordinates": [x1_normalized, y1_normalized, x2_normalized, y2_normalized]
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}


IMPORTANT FOR BLANK PAGE INSERTION:
- A blank page is ALWAYS inserted (insert_blank_page is always true)
- The blank page entry should have: "Is_Inserted_Blank": true, "Blocks": []
- All pages AFTER the blank page must have their Page_Number adjusted accordingly
- Original_Page_Number tracks the original position for coordinate reference

Example when BOTH pages are >50% empty (blank inserted at position 1):
Condition: page_1_empty_percentage=75, page_2_empty_percentage=80 (both > 50%)
- Page 1: Page_Number=1, Original_Page_Number=null, Is_Inserted_Blank=true (NEW BLANK)
- Page 2: Page_Number=2, Original_Page_Number=1 (was originally page 1)
- Page 3: Page_Number=3, Original_Page_Number=2 (was originally page 2)
- Page 4: Page_Number=4, Original_Page_Number=3 (was originally page 3)
- Page 5: Page_Number=5, Original_Page_Number=4 (was originally page 4)

Example when BOTH pages are >20% but NOT both >50% (blank inserted at position 3):
Condition: page_1_empty_percentage=35, page_2_empty_percentage=45 (both > 20%, but not both > 50%)
- Page 1: Page_Number=1, Original_Page_Number=1
- Page 2: Page_Number=2, Original_Page_Number=2
- Page 3: Page_Number=3, Original_Page_Number=null, Is_Inserted_Blank=true (NEW BLANK)
- Page 4: Page_Number=4, Original_Page_Number=3 (was originally page 3)
- Page 5: Page_Number=5, Original_Page_Number=4 (was originally page 4)

Example when either page has ≤20% empty (blank inserted at position 1):
Condition: page_1_empty_percentage=15, page_2_empty_percentage=70 (page 1 is ≤20%, has content)
- Page 1: Page_Number=1, Original_Page_Number=null, Is_Inserted_Blank=true (NEW BLANK)
- Page 2: Page_Number=2, Original_Page_Number=1 (was originally page 1)
- Page 3: Page_Number=3, Original_Page_Number=2 (was originally page 2)
- Page 4: Page_Number=4, Original_Page_Number=3 (was originally page 3)
- Page 5: Page_Number=5, Original_Page_Number=4 (was originally page 4)

⚠️ FINAL REMINDER - VALID JSON OUTPUT REQUIRED ⚠️
- All coordinate values must be PURE DECIMAL NUMBERS between 0.0 and 1.0
- NEVER insert words, adjectives, or any text inside coordinate arrays
- NEVER let content from one JSON field leak into another field
- Keep "text" field content COMPLETELY SEPARATE from "Coordinates" array
- Example: [0.12, 0.45, 0.89, 0.52] ✓ CORRECT
- Example: [0 astounding, 0.45, 0.89, 0.52] ✗ WRONG - will break JSON parsing
- Example: [0.12, 0.45, विशेषाधिकार, 0.52] ✗ WRONG - Hindi text in coordinates
- The output must be valid, parseable JSON with no syntax errors

⚠️ SELF-CHECK BEFORE RETURNING RESPONSE:
1. Verify every "Coordinates" array has exactly 4 decimal numbers
2. Verify no text content appears inside any coordinate array
3. Verify the JSON is syntactically valid and can be parsed
